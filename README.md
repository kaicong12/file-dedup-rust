# File Deduplication System

A production-ready file deduplication system built with Rust and React, featuring secure multi-user support, real-time processing, and comprehensive monitoring.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Frontend (React)

- **Secure Authentication**: JWT tokens with proper session management
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for job status notifications
- **File Upload Interface**: Drag-and-drop with progress tracking
- **Result Visualization**: Interactive displays of deduplication results
- **Client-side Security**: Rate limiting and input validation

### Backend (Rust)

- **Async Architecture**: Built on Actix-web for high performance
- **Job Queue System**: Redis-powered queue for long-running tasks
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with row-level security (RLS)
- **Deduplication Engine**: SHA-256 hashing + OpenSearch based for near duplication
- **Multi-tenancy**: Complete user isolation and data security

## üîí Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token generation and validation
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - 10 API calls/minute
  - 5 authentication attempts/minute
  - 2 file uploads/minute

### Input Validation & Protection

- **File Validation**:
  - Strict MIME type checking
  - 100MB per file limit
  - 1000 files per job maximum
- **Security Scanning**:
  - Filename sanitization (prevents path traversal)
  - Basic malware detection (ClamAV extensible)
- **SQL Protection**: Parameterized queries prevent injection attacks

### Infrastructure Security

- **Transport Security**: HTTPS with TLS 1.2+
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx with request filtering
- **Container Security**: Resource limits and isolation
- **Intrusion Prevention**: Fail2ban integration

## ‚ö° Performance & Scalability

### Job Queue System

- **Async Processing**: Redis-backed queue system
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple worker instances
- **Error Handling**: Dead letter queues for failed jobs
- **Priority Management**: Separate queues for admin tasks
- **Real-time Feedback**: WebSocket progress updates

### Database Optimization

- **Query Performance**: Comprehensive indexing strategy
- **Connection Management**: Pooling for efficiency
- **Data Lifecycle**: Automated cleanup of old data
- **Resource Management**: Per-user storage quotas

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Load Balancing**: Multiple backend instances
- **Worker Scaling**: Configurable worker processes
- **Proxy Configuration**: Nginx upstream load balancing
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for container management

## üê≥ Production Deployment

### Docker Infrastructure

- **Optimized Images**: Multi-stage builds for minimal size
- **Data Persistence**: PostgreSQL with volume mounting
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for queues and session storage
- **SSL Termination**: Nginx reverse proxy with HTTPS
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus and Grafana integration

### Security Hardening

- **Network Security**: Firewall configuration and rules
- **Certificate Management**: SSL with automatic renewal
- **Intrusion Detection**: Fail2ban monitoring and response
- **Security Policies**: Complete CSP and security headers
- **Resource Controls**: Container limits and quotas

### Monitoring & Alerting

- **Application Metrics**:
  - Request rates and response times
  - Error rates and queue depth
  - User activity and job completion rates
- **System Metrics**:
  - CPU, memory, and disk utilization
  - Network traffic and latency
  - Container health and resource usage
- **Security Metrics**:
  - Failed authentication attempts
  - Rate limit violations
  - Malware detection events
- **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards with configurable alerts

### Backup & Recovery

- **Database Backups**: Automated daily PostgreSQL dumps
- **Off-site Storage**: S3 integration for backup retention
- **File Protection**: Upload backup and versioning
- **Disaster Recovery**: Complete restoration procedures
